# ColorMaster

This is a re-envisioning of a bootcamp’s classic vanilla javascript color guessing game. 
Recreated in React, this app depends on react context to create “global” data and functions available to various nested components that make up the game. 

This guessing game generates an array of RGB color values and the player must visually determine the color they believe matches the randomly selected RGB value on display.  Points are calculated by difficulty and number of guesses and displayed as a progress bar integrated into the title. Animations and cheeky taunts inject a little personality into the new user interface.
